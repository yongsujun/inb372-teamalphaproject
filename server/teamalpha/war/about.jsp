	        For caregivers watching over dementia patients, 
	        there is always the danger of the patient becoming lost or disoriented on their own. 
	        Now, the company ALPHA has developed a smart watch with GPS capacity which would allow
	        a patient to be traced easily should they become lost or disoriented. 
	        The location of the wearer can be traced via an accompanying smartphone app or 
	        website with the use of Google Maps. The device, which looks like an old school 
	        digital watch, can also detect when the wearer has fallen, has a panic button which 
	        sends a text message in case of emergency, and also carries the user name, address 
	        and reminder for medication and doctor appointments.
